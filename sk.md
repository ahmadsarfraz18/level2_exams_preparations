The endless blue, a restless heart,
Where sky and water play their part.
A constant hum, a mighty roar,
As waves break on the sandy shore.
It calls us close, then pulls away,
A shifting spirit, night and day.

From tranquil glass to tempest's might,
It mirrors sun, then swallows light.
With emerald depths and sapphire gleam,
A waking world, a vibrant dream.
The white-capped horses, wild and free,
Dance on the surface, endlessly.

Beneath the foam, a hidden world,
Where ancient secrets are unfurled.
Of coral castles, silent deep,
Where strange and wondrous creatures sleep.
A siren's song, a whispered lore,
From darkest trench to sunlit floor.

It carves the cliffs, it smooths the stone,
Its power felt, forever known.
A gentle lapping, soft and low,
Then furious currents ebb and flow.
It takes and gives, with stern command,
The wild, untamed, across the land.

Oh, mighty sea, both old and new,
My spirit yearns to be with you.
A timeless wonder, deep and wide,
Where peace and passion both reside.
Forever changing, ever free,
The boundless, breathing, ancient sea.
